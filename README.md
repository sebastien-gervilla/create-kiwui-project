# Create Kiwui Project

A quick way to start a kiwui project.

## Installation

Just install the package globally with :

`npm i -g create-kiwui-project`

## Usage

You can initialize a project by using :

`npx create-kiwui-project <project-directory> [options]`


You will be asked asked a couple questions to determine you project configuration, like :

`✔ Would you like to use TypeScript ? … No / Yes`

If you want to skip this, you can create you project by providing 
necessary options, more info with :

`npx create-kiwui-project --help`

## Templates

For the moment, only the `default` template is available, but more will come soon !
